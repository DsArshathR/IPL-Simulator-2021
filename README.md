# IPL T20 ball-by-ball simulator

In the first one, you can play any two IPL teams by inputting their initials (eg. DC, CSK, PBKS, etc.).
In the second, you just open it and simulates and entire IPL season, all the scorecards are saved in the /scores folder along with the batStats.txt and bowlStats.txt files.
In the third, you can simulate the remainder of the IPL 2021 season that has been suspended for now.

### Bugs
1. There are no no-balls or byes
2. Sometimes the chase is a little slower during the middle overs.
